 **About me:**
After graduating from Belarusian State University with a manager's degree, I decided to discover the field of IT, because previously I've never worked in this sphere. I'd been only working as a content and social media manager. I also got the experience of being a copywriter. 
In February 2020 I finished the FrontEnd courses in IT-Academy in Minsk and realized that this is what I really would like to do every single day right now.
Learning is my passion, and  I am kinda an eternal student. The IT attracts me by the fact that there is no limit to perfection. You can learn something new every day and still will never know everything.

**My skills:**
HTML5, CSS3, the basics of JavaScript.

Bootstrap, BEM, SMACSS.

GitHub, FileZilla.

**Code example:**
```
<div class="section">
    <div class="container">
        <div class="row">
        <div class="section-title">
            <span>pricing plans</span>
            <p class="subtitle">No hourly rates. We plan our timeline and budget to achieve what we've agreed on, even that empty state you might have forgotten.</p>
 </div>
      </div>
       <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-4 col-sm-6 col-xs-12">
           <div class="pricing-plan">
            <div class="pricing-title monsterrat uppercase">basic</div>
               <div class="price monsterrat uppercase">$35.99 monthly</div>
            <ul class="list" style="padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 10px">
                <li>Traditional marketing</li>
               <li>Content marketing</li>
                <li>SEO marketing</li>
                <li>Social media</li>
                <li>Infographics</li>
				<li>Blog posts</li>
            </ul>
            <a href="" class="button-green2"><span>get started</span></a>

          </div>
